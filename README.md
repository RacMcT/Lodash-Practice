# Lodash-Practice

Practice using Lodash

# Assignment Specs:

Then use npm init to initialize the repo for Node.
Hit ENTER multiple times to generate an empty and basic package.json.
Install lodash.

Build a simple terminal app that uses at least 5 lodash methods.
Use fake data or APIs you have worked with in previous projects or google fake data you can use. Either make a fetch or save it in a few variables.
Console.log the output of each lodash method called on the fake data.
Use at least these methods: _.chunk(), _.reverse(), _.without(), _.shuffle().
Create unit tests with Mocha for each function you build.
TIP: use the data from day 11 for arrays and objects to tinker with. Or google fake data.

# Lodash Practice

Lodash Practice is a series of lodash functions that return results of manipulated arrays and data in the terminal.

## Installation
